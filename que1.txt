#!/bin/bash

function file_type() {
  for file in "$@"
  do
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then
      echo "$file is a regular file"
    elif [ -d "$file" ]; then
      echo "$file is a directory"
    else
      echo "$file is another type of file"
    fi
  done
}

function file_count() {
  local count=0
  for file in "$@"
  do
    if [ -f "$file" ] || [ -d "$file" ]; then
      ((count++))
    fi
  done
  echo "Total number of files and directories: $count"
}

function ls_long() {
  for file in "$@"
  do
    if [ -e "$file" ]; then
      echo "Details of $file:"
      ls -l "$file"
    else
      echo "$file does not exist"
    fi
  done
}

file_type "$@"
file_count "$@"
ls_long "$@"

Save the script in a file with a .sh extension and make it executable using chmod +x filename.sh. You can then run the script and pass in the names of the files/directories you want to analyze as arguments.
